# AI-Neural-Networks
Creating an Artificial Neural Network that is trained to recognize handwritten digits. The network is trained using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The programs will test the effectiveness/accuracy of identifying a new set of handwritten digits. There are various types of network sizes, training algorithms, and analysis techniques used.

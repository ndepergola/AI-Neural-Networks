# AI-Neural-Networks
Creating an Artificial Neural Network that is trained to recognize handwritten digits. The network is trained using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The programs will test the effectiveness/accuracy of identifying a new set of handwritten digits. There are various types of network sizes, training algorithms, and analysis techniques used. 

NOTE: All code was originally created/compiled in a Jupyter Notebook Python 3.

FILE LIBRARY:

ANN_1: First ANN created with one hidden layer containing 30 neurons. Trains using 30 sets and ReLU function. 
ANN_1_outputs: Outputs of ANN_1. Plots showing accuracy, loss, and missclassification frequency of the network.

ANN_2: Bigger network than ANN_1. Two hidden layers with 50 neurons each. Trains on 50 sets of digits. ReLU function. 
ANN_2_outputs: Same output analysis as done for ANN_1
